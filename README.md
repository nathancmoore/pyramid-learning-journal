Project name: Pyramid Learning Journal

There are 4 html templates, and each is associated with a route in routes.py.

Each of those views is handled by a function which is in views/default.py.

The home page shows a list of journal entries, the detail page is a planned scaffold for looking at a single entry.
the update page allows for changing of an entry, and the new page will allow for writing and posting a new entry.

I would put a link to heroku here, but because linux is terrible, i cant install anything right now. I I will fix this later.
